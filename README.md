# VS code and Atom

## atom

* Pros:

1. Same as Vs coding and you can play with coding.

2. Its easier use because its connecting with GitHub.

3. I will recomend to try to use atom. 

* cons:

1. Uncofortable to use Terminal like VS code. You need to find "platformio-ide-terminal" package" and download terminal. 

2. There is no Extension its hard to find the system. 

3. Its not automectly types like VS code. You need to type it by your hand.

### If you want a try use Atom here is instruction.

1. Go to (https://atom.io/)[atom] and download. 

2. When its done downloading set up or try to play with it. 

3. If you want a push to GitHub, than download **"platformio-ide-terminal package"** and than go to (https://atom.io/packages/platformio-ide-terminal) this website and click install. Its will show you how to download. 

4. Than type same code:
- Git init
- Git add .
- Git commit -m "message"
- create raptory
- URL( copy URL form GitHub)
- Git push -u origin master/main branch. 

5. start playing with it. 

## comment

I was use atom code program when I was study web Design but for web developers just follow the intorctor said. My instructor said VS code is best for VS code. If your web develpers, use vs code don't use atom. Autom is just best to play with around.
